# react-lib-template
A template that aims to make the implementation of `React` component packages easier and more methodic.

## Usage

This repo serves as the template for the creation of MOXY's base `React` components. To use this, just select `@moxystudio/react-lib-template` as the template when creating a new repo for your new package, and you're all set to start working.

This template already includes a `src` folder, with 2 dummy files ready for you to start your work. `NewComponent` is a dummy component, available for demonstration purposes. Just rename `NewComponent.js` and change it according to your needs. An `index.js` for exporting is available as well. Do not forget to update the unit tests and try to reach as much coverage as possible.

In order to help make proper use of this template, here's a quick checklist with some crucial stuff to have in mind:

- Remember to change `package.json` name, description, keywords, etc.
- Review the dependencies, removing the unnecessary ones.
- Just to stress this out again: add unit tests and check for a good coverage. The closest to 100%, the better.
- Make sure to update the `README`, documenting the features of your component as best as possible.
