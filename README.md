# react-lib-template
A template that aims to make the implementation of React component packages easier and more methodic.

## Usage

This repo serves as a template for whenever you want to create a new package with an extractable React component. For this, just select `@moxystudio/react-lib-template` it as the template when creating a new repo for your new package, and you're all set to start working on your new package.

This template already includes the `src` folder, with 2 dummy files ready for you to start your work. `NewComponent` was chosen as the dummy name, just rename `NewComponent.js` according to your needs. An `index.js` for exporting is available as well. Do not forget to add unit tests for each.
